This is a collection of utilities I am writing as I do my AP Chem and AP Statistics summer assignments/homework. As of now the only purpose of this project is to help me learn and maybe save some time on assignments.

`stats.lisp` contains a function for computing averages and a dsl for expressing formula in terms of E, the expected value operator.
